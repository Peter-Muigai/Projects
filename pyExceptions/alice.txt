Electric transformers are essential components in power distribution systems but remain highly susceptible to theft and damage, particularly in developing nations such as Kenya. The incessant loss of transformer oil, copper wire windings, and other materials results in enormous financial losses, power interruptions, and increased operating costs for electricity supply utilities. Traditional security devices, including physical barriers and human surveillance, have proven to be inadequate in detecting or preventing such activities in real-time.

This project proposes the development and implementation of a GSM-based Smart Protection Unit (SPU) that integrates Load Cells, Infrared (IR) motion sensors, and Hall Effect sensors to actively sense and protect distribution transformers from theft and vandalism. The system detects abnormal behaviors such as mass loss, human detection, and disturbance in the magnetic field, transmitting real-time alarms through GSM to concerned authorities to enable rapid response.

The innovative multi-sensor fusion technology enhances detection and reduces false alarms through the utilization of intelligent thresholding and event correlation. The performance of the SPU will be validated in lab and field tests for sensor calibration, communications reliability, alert latency, and cost. The expected results are a validated real-time monitoring, remote alerting, and local alarm initiation prototype.

By utilizing inexpensive, locally made components and in-country GSM infrastructure, this research presents an affordable and scalable security solution tailored to the distribution environment of Kenya. Thus, the Smart Protection Unit represents a sensible path to safeguarding critical electrical gear and limiting Non-Technical Losses (NTLs) in modern power systems.
